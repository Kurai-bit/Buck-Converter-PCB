# Buck Converter PCB 

## Setup
Create a new branch with the task name and your git nickname.
Use LM2596 or similar buck converter IC.

## Goal: Design a compact PCB for stepping down 12V to 5V using a switching regulator.

## Tasks
Study the datasheet and understand inductor, diode, and capacitor selection.
Design schematic with input filter, switching inductor, diode, and output filter.
Layout the PCB with short high-current loops and low-noise design practices.
Include silkscreen labels and mounting holes.
Write a document explaining the buck converterâ€™s function and design rationale.

## Submit: Schematic, PCB layout, BOM, Gerber files, final design document.
## Estimated time: 2 weeks
